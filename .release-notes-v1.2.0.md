# Release v1.2.0: Customizable Deployment Configurations Path

## 🚀 New Features

### Customizable Configuration Path
You can now customize exactly where your Blade deployment templates are stored by adding the `deployment_configurations_path` key to your `config/self-deploy.php` file.

**Example Configuration:**
```php
return [
    'deployment_configurations_path' => resource_path('deployments'),
    // ... other settings
];
```

## What's Changed
- **`selfdeploy:create-deployment-file`**: Now creates Blade templates in the configured directory.
- **`selfdeploy:publish-deployment-scripts`**: Now looks for templates in the configured directory when generating shell scripts.
- **`vendor:publish --tag=self-deploy-views`**: The tag naming remains consistent, but the created configurations through Artisan commands will now follow your custom path preferences.

## Technical Details
- Added support for `deployment_configurations_path` config with a fallback to `resource_path('deployments')`.
- Updated `CreateDeploymentFile` and `PublishDeploymentScript` commands to use the dynamic path.
- Enhanced test suite to verify that directories are created and files are read/written correctly using the custom path configuration.
- Total tests: 14 passing (60 assertions) ✅

## Installation
```bash
composer require iperamuna/laravel-self-deploy:^1.2.0
```
