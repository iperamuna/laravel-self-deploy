# Release v1.1.1: Bug Fix for In-Memory Config Update

## 🐛 Bug Fix

This patch release fixes a critical bug where bash script generation would fail when immediately generating scripts after adding new deployment configurations interactively.

## What's Fixed

### In-Memory Config Update Issue

**Problem:** When users added a new deployment configuration through the interactive prompts and chose "Yes" to generate the Bash script immediately, the script generation would fail because the in-memory config didn't have the newly added configuration values.

**Solution:** The config is now properly refreshed in memory after updating the config file, ensuring that subsequent commands (like bash script generation) have immediate access to newly added configurations.

## Technical Details

- Added `config()->set('self-deploy.environments', $configs)` after `updateConfigFile()` call
- Updated test suite with new test for in-memory config verification
- All 14 tests passing with 59 assertions ✅

## Installation

```bash
composer require iperamuna/laravel-self-deploy:^1.1.1
```
